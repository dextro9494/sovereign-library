# Archive Integration Methodology

**Summary:** Dedicated workflow: separate execution mode from archiving mode (dedicated chat for legacy integration). Clean separation of concerns keeps velocity high and avoids the extraction swamp.

**Source:** Raw Transcripts TXT: Batch 7

## Notes
- Keep this as a “card” unless you’re expanding with raw excerpts.
- When expanding, add 1–3 concrete examples and link back to the relevant protocol.
