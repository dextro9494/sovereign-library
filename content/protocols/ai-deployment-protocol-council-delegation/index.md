# AI Deployment Protocol (Council Delegation)

**Summary:** Use different AIs as specialized processors with bounded missions. Operator remains Director; DeepSeek as primary architect; others as tactical recon, narrative, or stress-testers.

**Source:** Raw Transcripts TXT: Batches 3, 5–6

## Notes
- Keep this as a “card” unless you’re expanding with raw excerpts.
- When expanding, add 1–3 concrete examples and link back to the relevant protocol.
