After being unemployed since September (lost job with working agency, pneumonia from freezer work, Tempo-Team abandonment), found this part-time job online. Two rounds of video interviews. Started November 25, 2025.

## Function
Fortress Base: low complexity, high stability. Funds the rebuild. Reduces volatility. Creates space for sovereign construction.
