# Relationships

The people and connections that matter — what they are and what they aren't.

Knowing the shape of each support prevents leaning too hard on the wrong pillar. Each relationship has its function and its limits. This section documents both.

## The Boy Had None of This

The boy in that house had to figure it all out alone. No trusted voices, no one who knew him fully and stayed.

Now: a partner who knows everything. A Council for outside perspective. Clarity about what each one is and isn't.

None of it was given. All of it was earned or built.

## How to Use This Section

When isolated or overwhelmed, remember what exists. When tempted to over-rely on one support, check its actual function.
