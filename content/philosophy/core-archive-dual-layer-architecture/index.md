# Core + Archive Dual-Layer Architecture

**Summary:** System scaling principle: separate the blade (Core for acting) from the library (Archive for remembering). Prevents bloat and preserves operational speed.

**Source:** Raw Transcripts TXT: Batch 7

## Notes
- Keep this as a “card” unless you’re expanding with raw excerpts.
- When expanding, add 1–3 concrete examples and link back to the relevant protocol.
