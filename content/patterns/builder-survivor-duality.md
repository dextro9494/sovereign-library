# Builder/Survivor Duality

The two fundamental modes of operation.

---

## What It Is

The system runs on two alternating modes:

**Builder** — Designs the future. Sees possibility. Creates systems, solves problems, moves toward goals. This is the mode that wrote the Codex, planned the Library, imagines the world that could exist.

**Survivor** — Runs threat detection 24/7. Scans for danger, assesses risk, protects against harm. This mode developed in childhood when the environment was actually dangerous. It saved your life. It's not the enemy.

---

## How They Interact

Builder and Survivor are not opponents. They're partners with different functions. Problems arise when:

- Survivor vetoes Builder's plans without new threat data (lockout)
- Builder ignores Survivor's warnings and runs into predictable harm
- Either mode runs continuously without handoff

The goal is not to eliminate Survivor. The goal is accurate threat assessment. When there's real danger, Survivor should run. When the danger is historical pattern, not present reality, Builder should lead.

## Field Evidence

- December 2025: Nightmare triggered old pattern. Survivor engaged briefly. Builder resumed within an hour. Evidence that handoff is improving.
- v7.0 fragmentation: Builder created elaborate system. Survivor flagged weight as threat. Both were right — system was too heavy AND Survivor's veto was disproportionate.

## Connected Protocols

- **5-Second Ignition** — Bypasses Survivor lockout when threat is not current
- **Circuit Breaker** — Auto-expires Survivor veto after 72 hours without new data
