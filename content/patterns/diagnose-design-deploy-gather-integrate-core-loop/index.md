# Diagnose → Design → Deploy → Gather → Integrate (Core Loop)

**Summary:** Operational flywheel: diagnose constraints, design an asymmetrical solution, deploy, gather data, integrate back into system. Turns ‘failure’ into telemetry.

**Source:** Raw Transcripts TXT: Batches 1–3

## Notes
- Keep this as a “card” unless you’re expanding with raw excerpts.
- When expanding, add 1–3 concrete examples and link back to the relevant protocol.
