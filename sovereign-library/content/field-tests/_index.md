# Field Tests

Theory meets reality — what happened when I actually tried things.

Ideas mean nothing until tested. This section documents real-world applications of patterns, protocols, and philosophies. What worked, what didn't, and what was learned.

## Documented Tests

*(Entries will be linked here as they're added)*

- **Procurement Validation** — First real-world application of Builder systems
- **Nightmare Recovery (December 2025)** — Pattern change evidence

## How to Use This Section

Before trusting a pattern or protocol, check if it's been field-tested. Untested theory is hypothesis. Tested theory is knowledge.
