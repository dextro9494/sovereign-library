# Philosophy

What I believe — the worldview I've built and the world I'd build if I could.

These aren't inherited beliefs. They were constructed through observation, simulation, and hard experience. They're not fixed — they evolve as new data comes in. But they're the current operating framework.

## Core Philosophy

*(Entries will be linked here as they're added)*

- **The Doctrine** — The core operating creed
- **The World I'd Build** — Contribution as currency, dignity by birthright
- **Monkey and Elephant** — Why standard tests fail non-standard minds
- **Ten Billion as Potential** — Organization problem, not population problem
- **Evolution from Cruelty to Fairness** — Strategy, not morality

*"The world I want to build for everyone is the world I never had for myself."*

The fair world with birthright dignity and basic needs met is what would have let the boy in that house actually rest.
